Exercises

1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:
	- Making coffee
	- Washing dishes
	- A choice of your own

A: 

making coffee

	GET filter, glass of water, and your choice of coffee roast
	SET filter into filter basket
	CALCULATE one cup of coffee roast onto the filter
	CALCULATE water
	SET water into coffee machine
	INIT machine to start brewing

Washing dishes

	INIT water
	INIT dishes
	INIT scrub

	FOR each dirty dish
	
	scrub each dish

	ENDFOR
	
A choice of your own: shave face

	GET razor and shaving cream
	SET water to face
	DETERMINE shaving cream onto face
	INIT razor to targeted facial areas
	
	

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

A: 
1) Kayak. Kayak produces results from many different websites on the best value. Their algorithm makes guess if the price is over, under, or at value to buy. 
2) Starbucks. People can order from a variety of options. They can order in the store, online, or an app.
3) Amazon. Users can choose their results in terms of relevance, price, reviews, etc. It also suggest similar items others ordered to help improve your search


3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.


The goal of an algorithm is do something. A good algorithm accomplishes the goal with efficiency and clarity. A bad one are ones that are complex to understand. With time being an important factor in people's lives, having something convenient and quick is a high priority to consider.
