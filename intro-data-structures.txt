Exercises:

1a. Use an array input: [“Vivian”, “Ava”, “Josh”, “Patrick”, “Mike”]

INIT guestRiders to an empty array
SET guestRiders [FIRST INDEX] to Vivian
SET guestRiders [Second INDEX] to Ava
SET guestRiders [THIRD INDEX] to Josh
SET guestRiders [FOURTH INDEX] to Patrick
SET guestRiders [FIFTH INDEX] to Mike

1b. Insert a new person, “Mary” at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike. 

PUSH Mary to guestRiders

1c. Find a person in line named “Josh.” This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).

INIT rider to FINDINDEX name
IF name equals Josh THEN
	RETURN index number
END IF
PRINT rider

1d. Find person in line named “Emily”. What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?

INPUT Emily

FOR each person in the array

IF Emily is in the array THEN
	
	RETURN true

ELSE 
	RETURN false
END IF

END FUNCTION

1e.What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?

SPLICE Melissa to start at [SECONDINDEX] to array 

1f. If Patrick wants to leave the line how would delete him from the array?

SPLICE at the start of the [THIRDINDEX] to remove Patrick from the array

2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

A: Registering at the ER

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate your data?

A: Devolopers can manipulate and access the  data in terms of priority, stance in line, etc. For example, if a patient with a serious illness enters, he/she can jump in front due to the severity of the problem. It helps manage the hospital keeping track of patients coming in and out, accessing their medical information, etc.
