Exercises:

1a. Use an array input: [“Vivian”, “Ava”, “Josh”, “Patrick”, “Mike”]

INIT guestRiders to an empty array
SET guestRiders [FIRST INDEX] to Vivian
SET guestRiders [Second INDEX] to Ava
SET guestRiders [THIRD INDEX] to Josh
SET guestRiders [FOURTH INDEX] to Patrick
SET guestRiders [FIFTH INDEX] to Mike

var guestRiders = [“Vivian”, “Ava”, “Josh”, “Patrick”, “Mike”];

1b. Insert a new person, “Mary” at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike. 

guestRiders.push("Mary");

1c. Find a person in line named “Josh.” This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).

var rider=  guestRiders.findIndex(name =>name === "Josh");


1d. Find person in line named “Emily”. What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?

function findName(name) {

  for(var i = 0; i<guestRiders.length; i++){
    if(guests[i] ===name) {
      return true;
    } 
  }
   return false;
}

findName("Emily");

1e.What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?


function skipLine(name, friendName) {
  var indexNumber = guestRiders.indexOf(name);
  guestRiders.splice(indexNumber, 0, friendName);
  return guestRiders;
}

skipLine("Ava", "Melissa")


1f. If Patrick wants to leave the line how would delete him from the array?

function leaveLine (name) {
  var indexNumber = guestRiders.indexOf(name);
  if(indexNumber > -1) {
    guestRiders.splice(indexNumber, 1);
  }
  return guestRiders;
}

leaveLine("Patrick")


2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

A: Registering at the ER

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate your data?

A: Developers can manipulate and access the  data in terms of priority, stance in line, etc. For example, if a patient with a serious illness enters, he/she can jump in front due to the severity of the problem. It helps manage the hospital keeping track of patients coming in and out, accessing their medical information, etc.
