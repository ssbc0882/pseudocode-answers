Exercises:

1. In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it’s important.

A:  It s code that’s readable for users to understand,  and code that’s able to maintain through updating and changes. 

2. Read this article about Toyota and their use of bad code. Although you may not yet understand all of the topics discussed, think about another commonly used object that relies on computers and explain what would happen if the code was not created to an acceptable standard. 

A: Banking. Accounts rely 100% on computers to conduct business. If code is to acceptable standard, it would create many problems, small and/or big. One issue is creating long lines inside the bank and transaction errors. A big issue would create security issues because of sensitive information such as names, addresses, account numbers, social security numbers, etc. 

3. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refractor the code. 

A: I think it’s not clean code for a couple of reasons. The function name is not very meaningful because it doesn’t relate to what the action of the function. It looks like that it’s doing two things. 

FUNCTION convertToCelcius(Fahrenheit) 
	RETURN  (5/9) * (Fahrenheit-32);

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION convertToFarenheit(Celcius) {
	RETURN Celcius * 1.8000 + 32.00;

END FUNCTION

4.  Yes, I think it’s clean code because the function name tells what it’s main purpose is to calculate the percent. It has variables that directly relates to code.

5a. The following function prints the subtotal of a customer’s transaction and receives payment accordingly.

INIT tax
INIT discountRate

FUNCTION getPayment (subTotal)
	

	PRINT “Your total due: is: “ + subtotal  *discountRate + (subtotal * tax)

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION changeBack (cash)

	PRINT “Change due: “ + cash - subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)

END FUNCTION

END chargedCredit(subtotal) {
	
	PRINT “Your credit card has been charged: “ + subTotal * discountRate + (subtotal * tax)

END FUNCTION

5b. The following function checks out a book if there are no issues with the guest’s account.


FUNCTION guestAccount
	PRINT guest.accountActive
	PRINT guest.hasOverdueBooks
	PRINT guest.outstandingFees

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)

IF book.status is not checkout THEN

	APPEND book to guest.books

	PRINT “Your books have been issued”

ELSE 
	PRINT “Unable to check out book.”

END IF

END FUNCTION
	
5c. The following class is a code snippet that should support the transactions a customer can perform at an ATM.

CLASS BankAccount

FUNCTION displayBalance
	
	PRINT balance

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION deposit (amount)
	
	SET balance to balance + amount

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION withdrawl (amount)

	IF balance > amount THEN
	
	SET balance to  balance - amount

	END IF

END FUNCTION

END

CLASS BankOffers

FUNCTION creditCardOffer

	IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
	
	CALL offerCreditCard

	END IF

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION checkStatus

	IF NOT (customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
	
	CALL offerCheckingAccount

	END IF

END FUNCTION

END

Programming Questions

6. Square Given an array of integers, find out whether the sum of the integers is a perfect square. If it is a perfect square, return the square root, otherwise return the sum. 

function perfectSquareArray (array) {
	var sum = 0;
	for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
		sum = sum + array[i];

	}
	if (Math.sqrt(sum) % 1 === 0) {
		return Math.sqrt(sum);
	} else {
		return sum;
	}
}

7. Duplicate Given an array of integers, find out whether the array contains any duplicate elements. The function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and false if every element is distinct. 

function isDuplicateArray (array) {
	var value = [ ];
	for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
	var currentValue = array[i];
	if (value.indexOf(currentValue) !== -1) {
		return true;
		}
		value.push(currentValue);
	}
	return false;
}
