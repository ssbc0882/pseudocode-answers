Short Answer:

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: It helps programmers, regardless of skill level, to follow the coding without understanding the particular language's syntax used in the computing field. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: It won't run.

Programming Assignment:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT two numbers
IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
	Display the first number
ELSE
	Display the second number
END IF


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT a total to 100
FOR each number is less than or equal than the total
	ADD number 
	PRINT number until it reaches total
ENDFOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INIT an entry
FOR each name in the phonebook
IF a name matches the entry THEN
	RETURN entry
ELSE
	RETURN "Not found" 
END IF

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

 function finder (entry) {

            for (i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
                if (phonebook[i] === entry) {
                    return phonebook[I]
                } else {
                    return "Not Found"
                }
            }
        }
